# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this my front-end coding challenge solution.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges helped me improve to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.


## The challenge

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size(However, I only coded for the desktop view}
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
